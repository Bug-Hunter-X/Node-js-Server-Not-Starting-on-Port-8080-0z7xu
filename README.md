This repository contains a simple Node.js HTTP server that demonstrates a common error: failure to start on the desired port due to insufficient privileges. The `server.js` file contains the buggy code, while `serverSolution.js` provides a working solution.  The error typically occurs when attempting to bind to a privileged port (those below 1024) without appropriate administrative or root privileges.
